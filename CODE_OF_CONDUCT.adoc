We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

  * Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
  * Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
  * Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback

    and learning from the experience

== Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for
moderation decisions when appropriate.

== Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an
appointed representative at an online or offline event.

== Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
sorairolake@protonmail.ch. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated
promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.
